POA:

The goal of this program is to create a functional Currency Conversion application that takes a specified
amount of currency, and converts to another specified amount of currency using spinner menu items and text
boxes. The program will also have a language changer based on region from ENGLISH to the specified language
depending upon the geological positioning of the device (I.E., the device switch will change to ENG/FRA if
you are in France, so on.) The device will need to be very adaptable to mobile phones and tablets, and also
requires portrait and landscape compatibility. 




Week 5 & 6 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2/1/2017 - Built the UI from scratch in the Main.axml
2/1/2017 - Brainstormed the application as a Currency Converter application. Application will convert a
specified GDP into a different GDP using GET and POST methods.
2/7/2017 - Planned attack for developing the operating use of each button, spinner and text box.

Week 7 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2/14/2017 - Focused on device orientation and the awareness of the orientation
2/14/2017 - Finished layout of Android app. Spinners, buttons and text fields in place.

LANDSCAPE AND PORTRAIT COMPATIBILITY <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
2/14/2017 - Setting up multiple viewports for application to be view-friendly during app rotation 
(Horizontal or vertical)

Week 8 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2/21/2017 - Began coding procedure for project, will also begin to think about different
resolutions of operation for the viewport.

Week 9 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2/28/2017 - Attempting to bridge the gap between the get set methods, the types of
currency configurations and references so that the app will build the Spinners
properly.

Equation will need to take amount of Convert From and Convert To currency, 
and display result of the difference in the Converted Amt. box.

So i.e.;

If 50.00 USD is input, and 1 USD = 0.93 GBP, the equation will do the math 
and then output this math to the Convert box in the converted 50.00 
amt in GBP.
